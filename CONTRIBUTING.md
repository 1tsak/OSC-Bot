# How to contributeüë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª

## Step 1 : Find an issue
- Take a look at the Existing Issues or create your own Issues!
- Wait for the Issue to be assigned to you after which you can start working on it.
- Note : Every change in this project should/must have an associated issue. 


## Step 2 : Fork the Project
- Fork this Repository. This will create a local Copy of this Repository on your Github Profile. 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/OSC-Bot
$ cd OSC-Bot
```

- If you have already forked the project, update your copy before working.
```
$ git remote update
$ git checkout <branch-name>
$ git rebase upstream/<branch-name>
```
## Step 3 : Creating new Branch
Create a new branch. Use its name to identify the issue your addressing.
```
$ git checkout -b branch_name
```
## Step 4 : Work on the issue assigned
- Work on the issue assigned to you. 
- Add all the files/folders needed.
- After you've made changes or made your contribution to the project add changes to the branch you've just created by:
```
$ git add .
```
## Step 5 : Commit

- To commit give a descriptive message for the convenience of reviewer by:
```
$ git commit -m "message"
```
## Step 6 : Work Remotely
- Now you are ready with your work in the remote repository.
- When your work is ready and complies with the project conventions, upload your changes to your fork:

```
$ git push -u origin Branch_Name
```

## Step 7 : Pull Request
- Go to your repository in browser and click on compare and pull requests. Then add a title and description to your pull request that explains your contribution.
- I will review your pull request and if it is up to the mark it will be merged.
